<button class="collapsible">What is Web Design</button>
<div class="content">
<p class="left">Web development refers to the process of creating and maintaining websites. It involves the use of programming languages, such as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, to build the structure, layout, and functionality of a website. Web developers work on various aspects, including designing the user interface, writing code for interactive features, and ensuring that the website is compatible with different devices and browsers. Their goal is to create a visually appealing and user-friendly website that effectively communicates the client's message or offers products and services to online visitors.</p>

<button class="collapsible">Why do you Need a Website?</button>
<div class="content">
<p class="left">In today's digital age, having a website is essential for small business owners, aspiring business owners, and store owners. A website serves as your online storefront, allowing potential customers to find and learn more about your business 24/7. It provides a platform to showcase your products, services, and brand identity to a vast online audience. A website also helps establish credibility and professionalism, as customers often research businesses online before making a purchase or visiting a physical location. Additionally, a website enables you to reach a broader customer base, expand your market reach, and even sell products or services online. It can serve as a powerful marketing tool, attracting new customers, building customer loyalty, and enhancing your overall brand presence. By investing in a well-designed and functional website, you can gain a competitive edge, increase your business's visibility, and effectively connect with your target audience in the digital landscape.</p>

<button class="collapsible">Why you should choose to work with me</button>
<div class="content">
  <p class="left">There are many benefits to being Freelance, working for myself and being in total control of the end product and everything in-between and theres quite a few benefits for yourself. It means we can have a more personal relationship while working together. The level of communication from working with myself compared to an agency or a larger company (in my opinion cannot be beaten). I can have more time with yourself and keep you updated throughout the entire design and development process.

  I can help you. Sometimes we don’t always have exactly what we want in mind, it can be difficult to visualize and sometimes it can change over time. I am more than happy to work with you regarding the design side of things, and give my professional opinion and advice on what I think will work and what wont, but that's entirely up to yourself as ultimtely its your decision and your website. For example I can help choose out a certain color scheme, font or images that I think would meet your requirements.

  I can design what you need and make sure it looks modern and professional for your needs, nobody wants a site looking like its straight out of the 90’s...Right!? Whether you need a simple landing page or a product release page or you're the owner of a cafe,restraunt or bar? Maybe you even run a small business and require a site to market yourself to potential clients? I am here to help.</p>
